        <h1 class="b1">Chapter 7 - Loops in Python</h1>
        <pre class="b2"> 
         
           Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program for instance: Print 1 to 1000
           Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer, which set of instructions to repeat and how!
        <h2>
        Types of loops in Python:( Primarily there are two types of loops in Python)
        </h2>
                    1. While loop  2.for loop
                       We will look into these one by one!
        <h3>1.While loop:-</h3>
        The syntax of a while loop looks like this:
While Condition: (  The block keeps executing until the Condition is true)
 #Body of the loop     
In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the Body of the loop is executed otherwise not!. 
If the loop is entered, the proces of [Condition check & execution] is Continued until the Condition becomes false.
{Quick Quiz: Write a program to print 1 to 50 using a while loop}
-An Example
i=0
while i<5:                   →Prints "Abhay-5 times!
 print("Abhay" )
               i=i+1
Note: If the condition never becomes false, the loop keeps getting executed

      <h3>2.for loop:-</h3>  
      A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence bite list, tuple or string .The syntax of a for loop looks like this:
      l= [1, 7, 8]
       for item in l:
      print (item)               →print 1, 7 and 8
    <h3>
     Range function in Python:
    </h3>    
    The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers. We can also specify  the start, 
    stop and step-Size as follows: range (start, Stop, Step Size)
                                                                              →step size is usually not used with range()
    <h3>An Example demonstrating range() function</h3>   
    for i in range (0, 7):                                        → range (7) can also be used 
    print (1)                              →prints o to 6
    <h3>for loop with else</h3>
    An optional else can be used with a for loop. if the code is to be executed when the loop exhausts
Example:
l = [1, 7, 8]
 for item in l:
	print (i km)
else:
print("Done")                                          →This is printed when the loop exhausts!
Output:
1
7
8
Done

    <h3>The break statement</h3>
    break is used to come out of the loop when encountered. It instructs the program to - Exit the loop row.
Example:
                 for i in range(0,80):
print (i)                        →This will print 0, 1, 2 and 3
                                            if i==3:
                                               break
    
     <h3> The continue Statement</h3>
     'Continue' is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one. It instructs the program to 
     "skip this iteration”.
    Example:
                            for i in range(4):
 				print("printing")              → if i ==2 Continue >if i is 2, the beaten
     if i==2:
            continue
                                                          print (i)
     

    <h3>Pass statement </h3>
    Pass is a null statement in python. It instructs to “Do nothing”
    Example:
               L=[1,7,8]
             For item in l:
                          pass                   →Without pass the program will throw an error
