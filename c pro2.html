    <h1 class="b1">Chapter-2 INSTRUCTIONS AND OPERATORS  </h1>
        <pre class="b2"> 
    A c programming is a set of instructions . Just like a recepic which contains instructions to prepare perticular dish         
    <h2> Types of Instructions </h2>
    1.	Type declaration Instruction
    2.	Arithmetic Instruction
    3.	Control Instruction
        
    <h2> Type declaration Instruction</h2>
    Int a;
Float b;
Other Variations:
Int i= 10 ; int j=i ; int a = 2
Int j = a + j - i;
Float b = a + 3;     float a = 1.1.         =>. ERROR! As we are trying      
                                                                        To use a before defining it.

Int a, b, c, d;
A=b=C=d = 30;             Value of a, b, C &d will be 30 each.
Arithmetic Instructions
Operators
Int I = (3 * 2)+1.                *,+ are operators
                                                      & 3,2,1 are operants
Operands can be int/float etc. 
+ - * / are arithmetic operators
Int b= 2, C =3 ;
Intz; Z = b+c;         Legal
Int Z;.   b*c=2;           x  Not allowed

%.  → Modular division operator
      /     =>  Returns the remainde
 %→ Sign is same as of numerator (-5%. 2=-1)
    
    <h2>Note  </h2>
    No operator is assumed to be present
    1)	Int I = ab          →Invalid
    2)	Int i= a*b.      valid
    There Is no operator to perform exponentiation in c  use However we can use in 6 pow (z, y) from <math.h 
      
    <h2>Type Conversion</h2>
    Type Conversion
An Arithmetic operation between
int and int = int
Int and float→Float
Float and float→ Float
5/2. = 2.           5.0/ 2 =  2 * 5             Important!!
2/5 = 0.                 2.0/5  =0.4
        
    <h2>Note</h2>
    Int a = 3.5;             In this lase 3.5 (flsat) will be demoted to 3 (int)   
    Because a is not able to store floats.
    Float a = 8;              A will store 8.0 
    8 -> 8.0 (promotion to float)

    <h2> Operator precedence In C</h2>
    3*x – 8y .  is (3x)-(8y) or.     3(2-84) ?
    In C language simple mathematical rules bike BODMAS, no longer applies.
    The answer to the above question is provided by by operator precedence & associativity
    Operator precedence: The following table lists the operator priority in C
           
    Priority           Operators
    1.	               *,    /,.  %
    2                  +,   -
    3                  =
    
    Operators of in the higher priority are evaluated first the absence of parenthesis.
    Operator Associativity: When operators of equal priorily are present present in an expression, the tie is taken care of by associativity.
    X*y/z.       -->     (xy) / z
    2/ y + z .   -->     (x/y) * 2
    *, /  follows Left to right associativity
    
    <h3>Control Instructions</h3>
    Determines the flow of Control in va program Four types of control Instructions in C in are
    1.	Sequence Control Instruction
    2.	Decision Control Instruction
    3.	Loop Control Instruction
    4.	Case Control Instruction.
